##Variables: It is a container to hold a value. Genrally in real time we use some kind of covers to carry things. similarly in programming language we use variables to hold values.In Java, there are different types of variables. They are:

String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false
Syntax:
type variable = value;

Eg: int myNum = 15;
      System.out.println(myNum);

##Final Variables: You can add the final keyword if you don't want others to overwrite existing values. We will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only.

Eg: final int m= 15;
m = 20;                // it will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable

##Java Identifiers:
All Java variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

Eg: int minutes = 60;

##The general rules for constructing names for variables are:

1. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
2. Names must begin with a letter
3. Names should start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace
4. Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
5. Names are case sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
6. Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names
