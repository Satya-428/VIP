Discription on simple code syntax:

class and classname: 
As we know Java is object oriented programming language (OOPs). An object cannot exist without a class and class is nothing but a blueprint on the basis how an object is created. Always a class name should start with capital letter.
Eg: class Employee{}

public static void main(String a[]): 
1) Every Java program requires a "method" to run the code. 
2) The default method is "main()" and every method returns a value and this main method returns null hence it is "void". main() method says that it will do work but it asks for a parameter in the form of "string array"
3)Java language works on objects. The objects works with methods. Hence there are two types of methods in java:
a. static method : It belongs to class
b. non-static method : It belongs to objects
What we use is the main() method belongs to entire class so we use "static" method
4) We need to access the main() method in whole program so we use a access specifier named "public".

Dispaly output:
To display any output like string/char/int/float/long basically we require a method called "print". This print method belongs to an object called "out". Finally the out object is inside a class called "System".

Eg: System.out.print("hello");

Note: In Java all class names start with capital letter and here String is a class in Java. So the point to be noted is whenever you declare a string variable make sure that the data type String starts with capital letter.
