##Java Type Casting: Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.
In Java, there are two types of casting:

Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte

##Java Operators: Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
In Java operators are divided into the following groups:

1. Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, %, /, ++, --)
2. Assignment operators (=, + =, - =, / =, % =,  =, | =, ^ =, >> =,<< =)
3. Comparison operators(= =, ! =, >, <, > =, < =) 
4. Logical operators ( &&, ||, !)
5. Bitwise operators (&, |)

Java packages are Built-in and User defined
